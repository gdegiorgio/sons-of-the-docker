# Sons of the Forest - Dedicated Server with Docker :skull:

Welcome to the world of Sons of the Docker! :ghost:

Prepare yourself for a chilling journey into the depths of containerization and beyond! :zombie:

## :fire: How to Run Sons of the Docker Server on Your PC

Follow these spine-chilling steps to summon the Sons of the Docker Server to your local machine:

### :computer: Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following ghastly tools installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - The gateway to the underworld of containers

### :zap: Pull the Image from Docker Hub

Open your terminal and unleash the dark magic with this command:

```bash
docker pull giovannidegiorgio/sons-of-the-docker:latest
```
:skull: Run the Server

Once the image is summoned, bring it to life with the following incantation:

```bash
docker run -d --name sons_of_the_docker -p 8766:8766/udp -p 27016:27016/udp -p 9700:9700/udp giovannidegiorgio/sons-of-the-docker:latest
```

### :eyes: Verify the Server is Running

Peek into the netherworld to ensure the server has risen from the depths:


``` bash
docker ps
```

You should see sons_of_the_docker_server among the undead containers.
:sparkles: Access the Server

Access now to Sons Of the Forest, you will see your Sons Of The Docker instance in the LAN server list!
